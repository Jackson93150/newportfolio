            Hi, my name is <b>Jackson </b>
            I'm 21 and I am a <b>Developer </b>
            and a student at <b>MyDigitalSchool.</b><br></br>I am someone who has loved
            <b> design, art and tech </b>since childhood. <br></br>Thatâ€™s why I tried to
            study design, but I prefer to do computer science and keep design
            as a passion. <br></br>Now I like to practice computer science and I like
            even more when I have to incorporate design. My goal is to be an
            <b> accomplished fullstack developer. </b><br></br>I also like to
            <b> read and watch manga, play video games and go to the gym.</b>
          </p>
